# hacker-rank-go
i have stopped doing the hacker rank problems. half the problems i have seen have wording so poor that you
read the problem text, have no idea what is asked exactly. you then check the discussion, only to find out
that everyone is trying to undestand what the problem is.

my time is precious. i am interested in findind solutions to problems
no spending 30 minutes reading 10 times the problem text, find out it's bullshit,
even the mathematical parts are usually wrong because the moron using them tries
to disguise the problem in maths before grasping math itself properly

the problem is not only the poor wording and bad content quality. it's that people have reported this
for years for some problems, and nothing gets fixed. this shows that hacker rank doesn't care about
quality content.

my time is precious, I don't throw it at people that can't manage to curate good quality content
just fuck off hacker rank
